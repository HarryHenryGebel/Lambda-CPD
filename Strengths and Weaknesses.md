# Building Professional Self-Awareness

## Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths

I have a lot of technical knowledge; I have been working with
computers and programming since 1981 and have acquired substantial
experience working with personal and open source projects. I have also
written some fairly large projects for my employers, but never in a
formal capacity as a software developer.

I am mature and well-acclimated to the workplace. I have always been
punctual and dedicated to my employer's values. I have usually ended
up having a side role in training, and am often a shop steward, a role
requiring the respect and trust of both co-workers and management.

### Weaknesses

### Impostor Syndrome
